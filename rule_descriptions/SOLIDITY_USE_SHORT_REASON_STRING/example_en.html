<p>In the following contract, this is an example of definitioned variable:
</p>
<pre>
<code>
    pragma solidity 0.4.24;

    contract A {
        require(balance >= amount, "To whomsoever it may concern. I am writing this error message to let you know that the amount you are trying to transfer is unfortunately more than your current balance. Perhaps you made a typo or you are just trying to be a hacker boi. In any case, this transaction is going to revert. Please try again with a lower amount. Warm regards, EVM");
      }
      
</code>
</pre>
<p>
    Better Alternative:
</p>
<pre>
    <code>
        pragma solidity 0.4.24;
    
        contract A {
            require(balance >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
          }
          
    </code>
    </pre>
